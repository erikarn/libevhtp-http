* Separate out "connect" errors from "socket closed before response" errors
* create a once-per-second timer for printing out periodic statistics
* add tracking for connect time, request send time, response htime, etc.
* .. maybe something to validate response bodies? (ie, no
  corruption by some proxy in the middle?)
* when we move from RUNNING to WAITING, the individual clients keep issuing
  HTTP requests - which is fine, but they should stop once they hit
  their limit.  Which is fine, except if the per-connection request limit
  is -1.  In that instance, they should go "oh, can't do any more new requests"
  and stop issuing requests.
