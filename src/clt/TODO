* Separate out "connect" errors from "socket closed before response" errors
* create a once-per-second timer for printing out periodic statistics
* add tracking for connect time, request send time, response htime, etc.
* .. maybe something to validate response bodies? (ie, no
  corruption by some proxy in the middle?)
